<img src="/assets/ContactFormEagle-153x300.jpg" align="left" alt="Marge 
Schneider holding an eagle puppet">Welcome! My name is Marge Schneider, and I have over two decades experience
 working with people of all ages and levels of functioning as an educator, complementary therapist, and spiritual counselor.

I created the first expressive puppetry program for adults in the United States, which was a breakthrough in reaching beyond the barriers of dementia and depression. With puppet in hand I was able to help my clients find their voices and tell their stories. Additionally, I developed a program that helped children and their families cope with the challenges of death and dying and find some inner peace and healing.

I’ve found puppets can help with a wide range of issues. I’ve seen puppets used with great success in challenging cases of dementia, depression, emotional issues in children and teens, end-of-life care, and bereavement. Puppets can help to reach deep expressive places and create heart-to-heart connections regardless of whether you’re a health care professional, caregiver, or helping a loved one.

I want to share my knowledge and expertise with you. I’m available to 
provide [workshops and presentations](/workshops)
for your organization or 
event, as well as [private consultations](/consultations) for nursing 
home 
residents and family members. Additionally, my book, *[A Hand in Healing: The
 Power of Expressive Puppetry](/get-book)* is available to inspire and 
 mentor you through the process of creating authentic, heart-to-heart connections.
