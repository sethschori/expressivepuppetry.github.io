I offer private consultations to people who are providing care to loved ones, especially those who you might be finding challenging to help. In these one-on-one meetings, I draw on two decades of experience as a complementary therapist and spiritual counselor. In addition to puppets, I can help with music, Reiki, and poetry. I can coach you on establishing meaningful and authentic connection and, if needed, help you assess the individual’s level of functioning. Check out the [testimonials](#testimonials) below!

I look forward to helping you learn how you can begin to lighten the heart, invite laughter and smiles, rekindle fond memories, and offer the magic of unconditional love.

If you would like to schedule a consultation or want more information, please contact me and we can move forward together to help bring love and meaningful, authentic connection into the relationship.

“How can I ever thank you for the special visits you have spent with my mother. Your special words, readings, singing songs with those wonderful puppets truly brought a twinkle to mother’s eyes. She felt your warmth and love…you have connected with her soul and prepared her for the next journey. You touched my heart and gave me so much comfort when I needed it most. You are a very special person with a very special gift; we will never forget you.”
<br/>*– Phyllis and Maria*

“I just wanted to drop you a note and thank you for allowing me to witness your work yesterday. I can’t tell you how delighted I was to see the effect your puppets, your warmth, your talents, and your love had on our patient. I have never witnessed an intervention that pierced the barrier of dementia the way yours did. You gave our patient back the ability to experience an intimate relationship which her illness had taken from her. Thank you for sharing yourself with our patients and hospice team.”
<br/>*– Tim Boon, Former VP for Hospice and Palliative Care, Connecticut VNA*
