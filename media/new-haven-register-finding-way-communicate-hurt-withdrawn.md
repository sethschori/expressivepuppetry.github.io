Jean Cherni: Finding a way to communicate with the hurt and withdrawn
---------------------------------------------------------------------

By Jean Cherni, Special to the Register

Every so often, I am challenged by some topic or person which I feel is so special, I worry that both the limits of column space and my writing skill will be unable to adequately convey their unique importance.

That is very much the case with Marge Schneider, who I met when I attended a get-together at the Blackstone Library. Marge and David recently moved to Branford after 40 years in Tolland, where they enjoyed living and tending to a four-acre property of organic vegetable and flower gardens.

They wanted to be near the water and also have easy access to Yale New Haven Hospital and found Branford ideal for their needs. Like many seniors, they had some difficulty with the transition to apartment living, leaving their community of friends and eliminating many family treasures.

<span style="background: rgba(199, 20, 139, 0.25); border-radius: 3px; display: inline;">Especially difficult was parsing Marge’s 
special puppet collection, which was one of the largest in the country. 
Schneider, as explained in her book, “A Hand in Healing: The Power of 
Expressive Puppetry,” uses these realistic hand puppets as therapeutic 
healing tools to help clients find their voices and tell their stories.</span>

<span style="background: rgba(199, 20, 139, 0.25); border-radius: 3px; display: inline;">You only have to be with Marge for a short period of time to understand why 
this passionate and caring woman is able to breach the barriers of dementia 
and depression. Marge, an educator, complementary therapist and spiritual 
counselor, has led many workshops and trainings for hospice, long-term care 
and numerous other facilities and organizations throughout the U.S. and 
Canada.</span>

Marge and David feel that connection is what life is all about. They met on a blind date when Marge was only 16, married at 19, and have been together for 53 years. They have always been civic minded and involved in organizations that try to improve the lives of others.

David has a master’s degree in public health and his later work with American Airlines, combined with their membership in a senior bed & breakfast club and a house-sitting organization, has allowed them to take inexpensive, extended vacations. They have gone to Hawaii, France and a small, traditional village in Morocco where they also took care of the owner’s three dogs.

They have two married sons and a granddaughter, Mika, who is 4 and loves to visit and play with her favorite puppets.

<span style="background: rgba(199, 20, 139, 0.25); border-radius: 3px; 
display: inline;">As many readers may recall, in the past, Howdy Doody, Lamb 
Chop, Charlie McCarthy and other puppets were influences in our childhood 
because they made us laugh. And laughter is a powerful medicine for 
reducing stress, altering perspectives, eroding loneliness and fostering 
hope.</span>

Welcome Marge and David! Branford is indeed fortunate to have you as new residents.
