I conduct interactive workshops and presentations in expressive puppetry across the United States and Canada, helping caregivers develop meaningful heart-to-heart connections. My workshops and presentations educate and inspire and have been enthusiastically received at local groups and national conferences, by nursing home staff, educators, activity directors, therapists, bereavement counselors, child and adolescent psychiatrists, social workers, storytellers, and gerontologists. Check out the [testimonials from participants](#testimonials) below!

I bring my two decades of experience as a spiritual counselor and complementary therapist to my workshops and presentations. I share examples of how you can begin using puppets quickly and under budget, and ways to encourage workplace humor, laughter, and creativity. Participants also explore how puppets can foster communication and help address some of the emotional issues that residents may have. The puppets I use:

* Offer the magic of unconditional love
* Invite laughter and smiles
* Rekindle fond memories
* Lighten people’s hearts
* Deliver important messages, such as acceptance, faith, respect and tolerance
* Help to reestablish a spirit of connectedness
* Unlock residents’ feelings and encourage communication

If you would like to book a program for your organization or event, or want 
more information, please [contact me](/contact). I look forward to sharing how you can integrate this innovative, joyful, and effective approach into your therapeutic program.
